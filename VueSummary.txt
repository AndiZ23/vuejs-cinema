Vue Component:
    like customizing a HTML element to encapsulate reusable code.
    1. Register components - templates, data, etc ...
    2. Put the customized element (the template) into html.
    * Compoents can have many Vue properties, including data, methods, and even components.
    !! Note that the data properties should be assigned a function that returns an object.

    template: -- what this component's gonna be rendered as HTML
    props: -- attributes in the html tag, children dom can access the value too
           -- props value can be dynamic, parent dom change the value and children get the change too.
                -- note: the change can only be passing down, not the other way

Custom events in Vue Component:
    A way that parent can listen to the child (listen the child for the event and parent capture it).
